## Hello there üëã

üõ† This is where I experiment with technologies and keep learning about AWS Services, Github Actions, Terraform, System Design patterns, Kubernetes, Ruby on Rails, Python and more...

<br>

üî≠ Currently working on scalability and availability solutions applying System Design Patterns and AWS Solutions.

üí¨ Ask me anything about Ruby on Rails, TDD, AWS Services, Kubernetes, Terraform, Github Actions and surfing spots in Portugal.

‚ö° One phrase that sums up my approach to life: _Looking for discomfort in comfortable ways_

üìçCurrently living and working in The Netherlands.

I believe the best place to work is the one where I can evolve and challenge myself in projects while collaborating with amazing people and working on platforms that improve people's lives on a daily basis.

Every time I go outside my comfort zone, I find myself traveling to unvisited corners of my mind, felling closely to untapped emotions, watching hidden desires become visible for the first time and I always come back to this:

The only constant throughout my life has been my desire to communicate and build.

I communicate by working on challenging projects, writing and condensing a decade worth of experience within my development blog, performing live music mixes, looking for outdoor activities and chess matches.

I build through software and infrastructure, system design, piano tunes, writing and sketching.
