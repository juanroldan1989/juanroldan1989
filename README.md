## Thoughts on the best work environment

I believe the best place to work is the one where _I can evolve and challenge myself in projects while collaborating with amazing people_ and working on platforms that improve people's lives on a daily basis.

Every time I go outside my comfort zone, I find myself traveling to unvisited corners of my mind, felling closely to untapped emotions, watching hidden desires become visible for the first time and I always come back to this:

_The only constant throughout my life has been my desire to communicate and build._

**I communicate** by working on challenging projects, writing and condensing a decade worth of experience within my development blog, performing live music mixes, looking for outdoor activities and chess matches.

**I build** through software and infrastructure, system design, piano tunes, writing and sketching.
