# Portfolio (Continuously Developed)

## Events Live Tracking App

The Events Tracking Platform is designed to monitor user interactions such as clicks and hovers on various colors, providing real-time graphs and counters.

Repository: https://github.com/juanroldan1989/color-tracking

### Features

- **Data Storage**: User events are stored in databases with support for both **PostgreSQL** and **Redis**.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Event statistics are shared via **Action Cable** for real-time updates to subscribed clients, or through polling JavaScript requests for specific clients.
- **Backend Implementation**: The backend is developed using **Ruby on Rails**, **Kafka**, and **Zookeeper**.
- **Deployment**:
  - Primary deployment workflow is managed through **AWS ECS** scripts.
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is handled using **Terraform**, with CI/CD integration via **GitHub Actions** into **AWS** (work in progress).
- **Alternative Implementation**: An alternative implementation of the API infrastructure and business logic is available using the **Serverless** framework. [Serverless Color Tracking](https://github.com/juanroldan1989/serverless-color-tracking)

## Sisyphus

A practical guide to modern infrastructure provisioning and application deployment.

DevOps-centric project that demonstrates modern infrastructure provisioning and application deployment workflows.

This project allows DevOps engineers and Cloud Architects to:

1. Operate within **specific** environments to which they have access.
2. **Add or remove** modules as necessary to build applications within their designated environments.
3. Deploy targeted applications or modules (e.g., **networking**, **karpenter**, **eks/internal-app**) within their specific environments.

Each environment folder (e.g., **dev**, **prod**) corresponds to a specific cloud environment.

## Personal quotes

- "Looking for discomfort in comfortable ways."
- "Don't confuse unfamiliarity with complexity."
- "To have something you never had, you have to do something you never did."

## Thoughts on the best work environment

I believe the best place to work is the one where _I can evolve and challenge myself in projects while collaborating with amazing people_ and working on platforms that improve people's lives on a daily basis.

Every time I go outside my comfort zone, I find myself traveling to unvisited corners of my mind, felling closely to untapped emotions, watching hidden desires become visible for the first time and I always come back to this:

_The only constant throughout my life has been my desire to communicate and build._

**I communicate** by working on challenging projects, writing and condensing a decade worth of experience within my development blog, performing live music mixes, looking for outdoor activities and chess matches.

**I build** through software and infrastructure, system design, piano tunes, writing and sketching.
