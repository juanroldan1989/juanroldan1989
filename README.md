## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

One phrase that sums up my approach to life: _Looking for discomfort in comfortable ways_

ðŸ›  This is where I experiment with technologies and keep learning about System Design patterns, AWS Services, Github Actions, Terraform, Kubernetes, Ruby on Rails, Python and more...

I believe the best place to work is the one where I can evolve and challenge myself in projects while collaborating with amazing people and working on platforms that improve people's lives on a daily basis.

Every time I go outside my comfort zone, I find myself traveling to unvisited corners of my mind, felling closely to untapped emotions, watching hidden desires become visible for the first time and I always come back to this:

The only constant throughout my life has been my desire to communicate and build.

I communicate by working on challenging projects, writing and condensing a decade worth of experience within my development blog, performing live music mixes, looking for outdoor activities and chess matches.

I build through software and infrastructure, system design, piano tunes, writing and sketching.
